# Overview

##### benchmark

- a benchmark is a performance test used to measure the execution time of a specific piece of code. Benchmarks are particularly useful for evaluating the efficiency of algorithms, functions, or code snippets to determine how well they perform under different conditions. The Go programming language provides a built-in testing framework, including the ability to write and run benchmarks.

##### Note

- 1 allocs/op means that each execution requires a memory space, and a memory space is 3 Bytes
